<h3>There are 360 Magic Square Transforms which Preserve the Determinant in GA5_4_1 Space</h3>
<p>
<p>
I have earlier looked at 72 remappings of Minkowski spacetime among itself based upon magic-square like transformations.
Now I have identified 360 determinant preserving remappings in five dimensional geometric algebra with a (4,1) signature.

<h3>Mink Magic Square Transforms Preserve the Determinant</h3>
<p>
<p>
I have earlier looked at 72 remappings of Minkowski spacetime among itself based upon magic-square like transformations.
These transformations, conveniently defined in the program below, preserve the determinant, as expected. Each of these 
72 transformations supports many (32) sign variations, per the unary complements discussed below.

<h3>Five Dimensional 4+1 Unary Complements Logic</h3>
<p>
<p>
Further investigation of the logic of the determinant preserving five dimensional 4+1 unary complements has been interesting.
The logic involved is indeed XOR logic. The independent variables are the q, w, x, y, z, and wx bits. The t bit is a 
dependent variable, t = q^w^x^y^z, meaning that q^w^x^y^z^t = 0 is a determinant preserving conservation law (CPT).
Our sixth independent variable turns out to be wx (or equivalently yzt). I haven't mapped out this error correcting code yet,
but I suspect we have a six bit information payload with five bit error detection and correction.
<p>
The determinant preserving logic equations look like extended parity, or error correcting code. The deduced equations are
given below.
<pre>
Independent variables - q w x y z wx

	yzt = wx;

	wxyt = z;
	wxzt = y;
	wyzt = x;
	xyzt = w;

	wxyzt = q;

	t  = wxyz = q^w^x^y^z;

	wt = xyz = q^w^y^z^wx;
	xt = wyz = q^x^y^z^wx;
	yz = wxt = w^x^y^z^wx;

	wy = xzt = x^y^wx;
	wz = xyt = x^z^wx;
	xy = wzt = w^y^wx;
	xz = wyt = w^z^wx;
	yt = wxz = q^z^wx;
	zt = wxy = q^y^wx;

<h3>Five Dimensional 4+1 Unary Complements</h3>
<p>
<p>
I provide a simple C program to enumerate all interesting (determinant preserving) unary complements in five dimensional 4+1 space.
Run time is about 30 minutes on my fastest machine. Sandwich product factors are shown on the far right. Notice left/right sign
symmetry between multivector left/right halves (duality related), and factor of (-1) between the first 32 multivectors and the
mirrored remaining 32. (@31 = - @32, @0 = - @63). These folded patterns are strongly reminescent of XOR logic.
<p>
Multiplying the original multivector times the selected complement results in
a new multivector, often with a large number of zero components. For example, Clifford conjugation, (index 1) times the original
multivector has a product with 20 of 32 components zero. The score parameter to the right of the multivector is this number of zero terms.
Because these complements preserve the determinant, the product of the complement and the original has a determinant equal to the square
of the determinant of the original multivector, but potentially far fewer terms. Searching for determinant preserving transforms
among the resulting 12 element multivectors directly leads to my amazingly efficient determinant formulas.

<h3>Five Dimensional 4,1 Symbolic GA Routines in C++</h3>
<p>
<p>
Electrogravity as well as general Dirac quantum mechanics requires a five dimensional spacetime.
I implement a geometric algebra using a (4,1) metric, matching a matrix implementation using 
Dirac Gamma matrices. The Gamma matrices are complexified 4x4 matrices, and have a complex
value for their determinant.
The pseudoscalar I = wxyzt mimics the complex i, and commutes with all multivectors.
The complex number made from (a + A*wxyzt) likewise commutes with all multivectors.
For the determinant and Adjugate, I have chosen to implement the complex result to
allow easy comparison between conventional gamma matrix versus GA results. However,
it is trivial to convert the complex determinant to a magnitude, typically for scaling
purposes to create unit magnitude multivectors.

<h3>Interesting Duals and Complements in Minkowski and Euclidean Spacetime</h3>
<p>
<p>
I provide sample C++ code finding all interesting duals and complements for Minkowski and Euclidean spacetime.
The geometric product of a multivector and the best duals and complements eliminate ten out of sixteen terms.
These are like extensions of the complex conjugate to four dimensional spaces. As such, they lead to great 
simplifications of formulas for determinants. Basically, a Reverse conjugation, products, complex-like conjugation, products yields
the determinant of a Minkowski multivector. The code below illustrates 12 different methods, all leading to the same result.
Here is my favorite.
<pre>
Start with a generic Minkowski spacetime multivector r.

Format for Mink is Mink(a_q, a_x,a_y,a_z,a_t, a_xy,a_xz,a_yz,a_xt,a_yt,a_zt, a_xyz,a_xyt,a_xzt,a_yzt, a_xyzt);  

r = Mink(a, b,c,d,e, f,g,h,i,j,k, l,m,n,o, p)

Form the Reverse Conjugate, (index 32736 in my codes below.)

s = Mink(a, b,c,d,e, -f,-g,-h,-i,-j,-k, -l,-m,-n,-o, p));  

Form Clifford product of r and s. Ten terms disappear in the product.

t = r*s = Mink(A,  B,C,D,E, 0,0,0,0,0,0,  0,0,0,0, P)

A = g^2+l^2+b^2-j^2-o^2-e^2+h^2-m^2+c^2-p^2+f^2-k^2-i^2-n^2+a^2+d^2
B = -2*e*i-2*n*k+2*g*d-2*o*p+2*f*c+2*h*l-2*m*j+2*a*b
C = -2*k*o+2*m*i+2*a*c+2*n*p-2*g*l-2*j*e-2*b*f+2*d*h
D =  2*j*o+2*n*i-2*m*p-2*h*c-2*k*e-2*g*b+2*d*a+2*l*f
E = -2*d*k+2*m*f+2*h*o+2*a*e+2*g*n-2*j*c-2*l*p-2*b*i
P = -2*b*o+2*j*g+2*n*c+2*a*p-2*m*d-2*h*i-2*k*f+2*e*l

We now form a complex conjugate-like term from t

w = Mink(A,  -B,-C,-D,-E, 0,0,0,0,0,0,  0,0,0,0, -P)

Multiply t and w

t*w = Mink(A^2-B^2-C^2-D^2+E^2+P^2,   0,0,0,0,   0,0,0,0,0,0,   0,0,0,0, 0)

This scalar term is the determinant of r, and it is the fourth power of the magnitude of the complete multivector.

This is very nice, as no matrix operations were used in this process!

We can do better!, We can now easily define the reciprocol of a Minkowski multivector!

Start with   t*w = w*t = det(r) = |r|^4

w  = det(r) *(1/t) = det(r)*(1/(r*s)) = det(r)*(1/s)*(1/r)

s*w = det(r)*(1/r)

(1/r) = (s*w)/det(r)

Verification is in Verify_Reciprocol.cp

This process works with 4D Euclidean space, as well. Of course, the details of the determinant
and reciprocol are different, but the process is the same.

<h3>Comparison of Hestenes' Regressive Product versus Lengyel's Antiwedge Product</h3>
<p>
<p>
The Hestenes' (1986) regressive product differs from the Lengyel antiwedge product. This note
presents multiplication tables for the geometric, wedge, regressive and antiwedge products,
and points out that the sign differs between the regressive versus antiwedge product when both
blade factors have odd rank.

<h3>Simple Proof that the AntiWedge Product is Associative</h3>
<p>
<p>
This is a simple proof that the AntiWedge product of Eric Lengyel and Leandro Fernandes is Associative.
Previously, I had frustration, wrongly implementing Hestenes' formula. I now show that the Hestenes 
regressive product (now correctly defined) is associative.

<h3>The AntiWedge Product of Professor Leandro Augusto Frata Fernandes</h3>
<p>
<p>
Professor Leandro Augusto Frata Fernandes, in 2013, posted a very nice set of notes as an introduction to geometric algebra,
including his algorithms for calculating wedge, regressive, left contaction and right contraction products. His regressive
product agrees with that of Eric Lengyel, increasing my confidence that their formulas are the true regessive product.
Implementation of his algorithm and results are in the c file linked below.

<h3>The AntiWedge Product of Eric Lengyel</h3>
<p>
<p>
Hermann Grassmann's wedge product has been widely adopted in physics and mathematics,
but the related regressive product is rarely presented. Eric Lengyel, in  Foundations of Game
Engine Development, Volume 1, interprets
the regressive product as a complement to the wedge product, and provides a geometrical
view of the regressive product as a measure of intersection of the multiplied elements.
Eric's most important insight is that the non-commutative nature of wedge multiplication
leads to two potentially different complements, being the right versus left complement. His
antiwedge product uses both complements, and achieves an associative antiwedge product.
<p>
This antiwedge product is associative, unlike Grassmann's variations, which gives me confidence
that this is a correct implementation. 
This note will be revised as I gain in understanding.

<h3>The Regressive Product Per David Hestenes (1986)</h3>

David Hestenes, in his  (1986) paper "Universal Geometric Algebra", provides a definition of an associative 
regressive product based upon the Clifford product. This note presents
multiplicaton tables and equation sets for the Hestenes regressive product in two, three and four dimensions.

<h3>The Regressive_AND Product</h3>
<p>
<p>
Hermann Grassmann's wedge product has been widely adopted in physics and mathematics.
However, the related regressive product is rarely presented, due to varying interpretations
and prescriptions for implementing the regressive product. Instead, various methods are
presented for unions and intersections, joins and meets.

This note presents a simple set of products based upon AND, OR and XOR logic operations
operating on geometric elements. These products are associative, in contrast with the
common regressive products. The program Regressive_AND_OR_XOR.cp is provided for associativity
verification.

<h3>Sample Curvature and Torsion Calculations Using Geometric Algebra</h3>

<h3>Sidetrack - Unary Operators and Determinants in Geometric Algebra</h3>
<p>
<p>
Using real matrix implementations of three dimensional Euclidean geometric algebra and Minkowski geometric algebra,
we can define the determinant of a multivector, which can be used as a measure of magnitude. Likewise, we can define
unary operators which change the sign of various multivector components in a fashion similar to complex conjugation,
which preserve the value of the determinant, but zero out substantial portions of the multivector product with the 
original multivector. This note documents the determinants in Euclidean and Minkowski space, lists the interesting
unary operators which preserve determinant, then documents efficient calculation of the determinant using these unary 
operators.

<h3>The Dirac Equation in 3D!</h3>
<p>
<p>
I've been through many variations trying to clearly understand the Dirac equation,
and quantum mechanics in general. This particular variation has me quite pleased.
The standard Dirac treatment appears to only partially occupy the four-space
and five-space standard implementations. I decided to drop down to three-space only,
and see what I could come up with. 
<p>
Using Euclidean, three-space geometric algebra, I find the Dirac equation maps
into a three-space, eight component multivector, as compared to the four component complex spinors.
More importantly, these eight components have a nice geometric interpretation.
The scalar equation corresponds to energy terms. We find three equations for linear
momentum, three equations for angular momentum (curvature), and one equation for 
torsion. I find that the wavefunction corresponds to a unit magnitude multivector
corresponding to a local Frenet multivector frameset, being psi = (1 + u + un + unb)
where the tangent u provides flowlines, and the curvature term un indicate normals
to the flowlines (akin to equipotentials in EM field plots).
<p>
I further find these equations, in the macroscopic view (where hbar multiplied terms are sent to zero)
provides coupling between linear momentum and angular space terms which are not part of our standard
technology. I expect these terms to manifest as an electro-gyroscopic effect, and intend to 
wind toroidal coils to realize these effects in hardware shortly.

<h3>Lists of Anti-commutating Sets in Minkowsi and Dirac Spacetimes</h3>
<p>
<p>
In Minkowski geometric algebra, I commonly use the anti-commutating vector basis (x, y, z, t). I found early on
that the quadvector xyzt also anti-commutes with the vector basis to make a set of five anti-commutating members.
Curious as to whether there were any other sets in Minkowski spacetime, I quickly found six total sets of five
anti-commutating elements, which could be used to factor the Dirac equation without sources, for example.
<p>
Knowing that several sets exist, the question arises of how many set exist, and what are their members. To answer
this question, I have written two small programs to identify and enumerate all anti-commutating sets in 
four dimensional Minkowski spacetime, and five dimensional Dirac spacetime.
<p>
This note documents the anti-commutating sets in Minkowski  and Dirac geometric algebras. I find
60 pairs, 80 triads, 30 tetrads and 6 pentads in Minkowski geometric algebra with a signature of (+ + + -).
I find 240 pairs, 640 triads, 480 tetrads and 192 pentads in Dirac geometric algebra with a signature of (+ + + + -).

<h3>Matrix Operations in Minkowski Geometric Algebra</h3>
<p>
<p>
Geometric algebras are associative, non-commutative algebras which can be
mapped to matrices. As such, the geometric algebras have matrix related operations, such as determinants,
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This note documents and provides formula for matrix related operations 
for the specific case of Minkowski geometric
algebra, using an east coast metric of (+,+,+,-).

<h3>Quantum Re-annotated: The Dirac Equation</h3>
<p>
<p>
This project began as a simple effort to cast the Dirac
equation into geometric algebra terms following the example
of David Hestenes, but using real 4x4 matrices as a geometric
algebra representation (with metric (+,+,+,-)), rather than the complex algebra matrices
used by Dirac. Each attempt (of many) to eliminate complex numbers failed. Upon admitting
defeat in fourspace, I realized that the complexified Minkowski fourspace describes 
a five dimensional geometric algebra, with signature (+,-,-,-,+). Having
made this realization, I quickly found many others, such as Jose Almeida in Portugal,
N. Redington and M.A.K. Lodhi (USA), and the grand master Dirac himself (1935) have 
made five dimensional models for the Dirac electron. 
<p>
This project is finally beginning to make me happy. At this point, the draft paper
derives a set of eight real (or four complex) component equations for the Dirac
wavefunction using the standard Bjorken and Drell matrices. I then set up a five
dimensional geometric algebra with signature (+ - - - +) matching the Bjorken and Drell matrices.
Corresponding to the column wavefunction, I have a left ideal multivector. I then recover
the same set of eight equation found in the standard approach.

<h3>The Magic Square at the Heart of Spacetime</h3>
<p>
<p>
Four two-by-two matrices can be used to implement two dimensional Euclidean geometric algebra.
The pair-wise direct product of these matrices provides sixteen real four-by-four matrices
implementing four dimensional Minkowski geometric algebra with (+,+,+,-) signature. These sixteen
geometric algebra elements can be arranged in a four-by-four grid sharing many of the symmetries of magic squares,
with the substitution of the geometric product in place of addition. Seventy two mappings in magic square format
and geometric algebra basis format are listed.
I suspect that these mappings may enable practical sigma deritrinitation.

<h3>Notes on 4x4 Magic Squares</h3>
<p>
Magic squares are usually presented as a mathematical recreation. These squares have
a sequence of integers, arranged such that the sum across each row, sum down each
column, and the sum across each diagonal equals the same magic constant. Within the
family of 7040 4x4 magic squares is a subset of 384 with an even greater degree of 
symmetry. These pandiagonal 4x4 magic squares sum to the magic constant along every
broken diagonal, glide path and 3x3 cell spacing. 
<p>
This note describes and provides source code for finding the 549504 semi-magic 4x4 squares,
where we only require matching sums across and down. The note then filters this list to 
identify the 7040 4x4 magic squares which also include the requirement that the diagonals
sum to the magic number, as well as the rows and columns. After that, this note filters
down to the 384 panmagic squares, which have 52 different formulas summing to the magic number.
Having found the 384 squares, we then look at Grogono's bit plane decomposition (magic carpets), 
finding a set of eight planar bit patterns, which can be derived from any one member by rolling 
and rotating operations.

<h3>Symmetries In Minkowski Geometric Algebra</h3>
<p>
Inside Minkowski Geometric Algebra with signature (+,+,+,-) are six subspaces with are isomorphic
to three dimensional Euclidean geometric algebra. As each of these subspaces has the same mathematical 
structure as three space,
we can use our standard tools, such as translations, scaling, rotations, cylindrical coordinates,
spherical coordinates, and so forth in these subspaces. 
A program demonstrating and verifying these six representations is 
<a href="Six_Euclideans.ginac.cp">Six_Euclideans.ginac.cp</a>

used in novel forms, as well.

<h3>Extending Geometric Algebra to Include Internal Orientation</h3>
<p>
Geometric Algebra in 3D Euclidean space can be implemented at least six
ways using 4x4 real matrices, using half the available degrees of freedom.
Digging into the multiple representations, we find 3D Euclidean geometric algebra
to be an even grade subset of a 4D Minkowski space with signature (+,+,+,-).
Usually, we stop here, and get excited about 3D space as a spinor subspace of 4D. 
However, I wanted to dig deeper, looking further into the symmetries
associated with this 4x4 matrix set of representations. What I came to realize,
is that we have nine elements which square to unity, which can be arranged into
a 3x3 grid such that across each row we have a set of anti-commutating elements which can be used 
as a linear basis, and down each column, likewise, we find sets which can be used 
as a linear basis. In the ordinary geometric algebra implementation, we indeed use one of
these sets for our spatial basis and associated trivector. We use another set for our
space-time bivectors, and the third set for three trivectors. However, the symmetries involved
give no special assignment among our six candidate arrangements. Looking at this from the
point of view of modelling an electron as a general purpose multivector, I find a neat opportunity.
Instead of viewing this 4x4 set of basis as a Minkowski spacetime, I look at this as a conventional
three space Euclidean algebra, augmented with two more displacements and associated trivectors.
These displacement may be independent deltas from a particle center, or may be internal degrees of freedom
somewhat like isospin. I prefer the real space delta, at this time. Given a three component model for the electron
of a luminal charge between two real magnetic monopoles of opposite polarity, this mathematical re-interpretation
is exciting.

<h3>Twelve Real Dirac Matrices</h3>

<h3>The Dirac Equation in Geometric Algebra</h3>

David Hestenes, Chris Doran, Anthony Lasenby, and others
have implemented the Dirac equation for the the relativistic electron in 
geometric algebra. David Hestenes, in particular, has shown how the 
geometric algebra view provides insight into electron motion.

This note starts with Dirac's development, then repeats the geometric algebra translation 
using a (-,-,-,+) signature. Finally, the same translation is carried out using a (+,+,+,-)
signature. The result is a purely real multivector Dirac Equation with no imaginaries.

<h3>The Stern Gerlach Apparatus</h3>
<p>

The Stern Gerlach experiment demonstrates separation of components of a molecular beam
via the force on magnetic dipoles in a magnetic field gradient. Most presentations of
the Stern Gerlach experiment are simple cartoons or pleasant animations, which leave
the real student hungry for detail. Fortunately, several schools, such as MIT, University of Wisconsin,
Singapore National University, University of Potsdam, University of Zurich, and RWTH Aachen
have replication of the Stern Gerlach experiment part of the standard physics curriculum.
MIT and University of Wisconsin have locally produced replications, while the other schools
I looked at were using variations on a trainer made by <a href="http://www.phywe-systeme.com">Phywe GmbH</a>.
(Phywe link requires cookies to be active.)
<p>

There are two major differences
between the original Gerlach Sterns versus the modern replicants. 
<br>
First, the modern replications use potassium,
rather than silver, as the atomic source. Like silver, potassium has a single unpaired 
electron in the outer shell. Potassium (63.4 C) has a much lower melting point than silver (962 C),
with the result that a 12W power supply is adequate for the furnace, and third degree burns are harder to obtain. 
However, potassium is more chemically reactive than silver, and requires 
<a href="http://web.physik.rwth-aachen.de/~hebbeker/theses/glauss_bachelor.pdf">attention in handling, 
operations and cleanup</a>. (Glauss' work also has a nice picture of the magnetic pole faces.)
<br>
The second major difference is that instead of a passive witness plate, as used in the
original experiment, PHYWE uses a Langmuir-Taylor surface ionization sensor. In this detector,
neutral potassium atoms hit a heated tungsten filament, and become ionized. These ions are 
accelerated by a 50V field, and impact a collector. Picoamp beam currents are routinely measured 
over a small area. This device does not provide a two dimensional 
display of beam intensity. Instead, a horizontal traverse is made by moving the sensor. This one
dimensional slice is only available in one plane. 
<a href="http://www.physik.uzh.ch/data/peter/PhysikIII/Anleitungen/SternGerlach.pdf">
University of Zurick</a> has a nice writeup, also showing the potassium oven as well as the Langmuir-Taylor probe.

project, this has nice mathematical detail concerning the beam interaction with the divergent field, and nice 
quality curves for beam current profiles at different magnet current settings. From the data presented, these various authors
calculate the magnetic moment for the potassium atom within a few percent of standard values.

<h3>The Lorentz Field</h3>
<p>
In the geometric algebra presentation of classical electromagnetics, we have
a multivector whose vector portion is the electric field, whose bivector portion
is the magnetic field, and whose scalar portion is a measure of deviation from
the Lorentz gauge. In this note, I propose viewing this Lorentz field Phi as of
equal status as the electric and magnetic fields. I provide wave equations for
E, B,  and Phi, and point out the coalescent nature of the 
Lorentz field. This presentation is not done in geometric algebra, but rather
conventional vector notation to allow easy comparison to standard texts, such
as Griffiths.

<h3>Pauli Equation and Geometric Algebra</h3>
<p>
This is the second set of notes looking at fundamental equations of quantum mechanics,
<p>
Wolfgang Pauli was adamant about keeping the spin axis distinct from the coordinate
space. Perhaps he was influenced by considerations of four dimensional space, where we can have two independent, 
orthogonal planes of rotation. Perhaps he viewed the electron as a point particle, and felt that a zero dimensional
point particle, lacking extent, could not rotate, generate a magnetic field or possess angular momentum. 
Unlike Louis de Broglie, Pauli was not open to the idea of an electron in continuous motion (action), self-interacting, 
following a curved path even in the absense of external magnetic fields. Regardless of how he felt, the
spin matrices he used in the development of the Pauli Schrodinger equations are a direct match for geometric algebra. 
<p>
Interestingly enough, all traces of the sigma matrices disappear from the actual set of wave equations. 
<p>
In effect, the sigma matrices and the geometric algebra were but a scaffolding to incorporate spin. Having served its purpose,
it is quietly removed. From this point of view, I think I can better understand Wolfgang Pauli. Slightly restating his position,
he made no assumptions about the nature of spin. It could be local geometric circulation. It could be some isospace separate from
our experience. From the point of view of the wavefunctions, the origin does not matter.

<h3>Dimensional Analysis of Multivector and Wedge Products</h3>
<p>
Geometric algebra defines composite structures of scalars, vectors, bivectors and higher order
terms. When two multivectors are multiplied, if the internal units are different, such as meters
for the vectors, meters squared for the bivectors, and so on, then the resulting product 
has mixed units in some of the product terms.

By contrast, when using the wedge product, the resulting
product has the same spatial unit arrangement as the two incoming factors.

Executive summary: 
<ul>
<li>
Multivector product mixes units. Plan to use dimensionless quantities, or uniform dimensioned
quantities when using the general multivector product.</li>
<li>
Wedge product preserves dimensionality in the product.

I repeat his derivation here, for 2x2 matrix representation of the 2D geometric algebra,
including more intermediate steps for easier understanding.

<h3>Onward to the Fourth Dimension!</h3>
<p>
A funny thing happened on the way to the fourth dimension. . . 
<p>
So I have been thinking about the relationship between Clifford Algebras and
matrix representations of these algebras. My initial belief has been that
the matrix representations are a useful, but coincidental mapping. However, looking 
at the two dimensional case, I began to suspect that there may be more than coincidence
in the mapping. Specifically, the two dimensional case showed a relationship between
rotary transformations and linear translations, where each of the four algebra elements
was both an element and an operator.
<p>
As I examined the three dimensional Geometric (Clifford) Algebra, it became clear
that 3x3 matrices could not represent 3D Euclidean Clifford Algebra due to the absense of 
bivectors which square to negative one. However,
in 4x4 matrices, six fundamental, and at least 48 representations were readily available. Now, in each of the
representations, each element has a non-zero determinant, which is inherently necessary for the
higher order multivector products to have non-zero determinant. This in turn is related to the
highest order multivector term having a hypervolume equal to the determinant of it's representation.
<p>
In effect, from the unit scalar, through vectors, through bivectors, including the trivector, each
representation for the three dimensional elements is algebraically a quadvector in fourspace.
From the coincidental, but useful mapping point of view, this is no big deal. From the literal
realities point of view, this is interesting indeed. Even more fun, is the categorizing of the
six fundamental representation as two independent sets of three, with the two sets dual to the other.
Regardless of set identification, the idea of three dimensional reality as a sort of downward projection of
a four dimensional greater reality is fascinating.
<p>
As I scan the matrix space for 4x4 matrices, I find 21 matrices sets (+/- factors between pairs) 
with zero trace, and non-zero determinant which square to one. In a similar fashion, I find only six pairs 
(+/- factors between pairs) 
which square to negative one. In Euclidean Geometric algebra, vectors and quadvectors square to one, while
bivectors and trivectors square to negative one. Given the single scalar, four vectors, six bivectors,
four trivectors, and single quadvector structure of this algebra, we see that faithful representation is 
impossible using 4x4 matrices, as we need ten independent elements which square to negative one, but only
six are available. 
<p>
(Updated Jan 20, 2016.) We have an interesting set of 4x4 matrices, listed below, which implements Minkowski spacetime. 
<p>
In the matrices below, I have 16 mutually orthogonal matrices. Ten of these, being the unit matrix, and nine others,
square to +1. The nine non-unit matrices are mutually anti-commutative, and their pair wise products
produce six other orthogonal matrices, which square to -1.

My current plan is to do some comparisions between the 2D Euclidean Algebra, the 4x4 simple representation, and the 2x2 'folded' representation.
The fact that the 2x2 matrix representations require non-zero determinants seems to put each of the representation matrices on a same footing,
as far as dimensional units are concerned.
<p>
After this, I intend to ponder the many Minkoswki implementations in 16x16 straight-forward matrix representation, as well as in the 4x4 
representations. I would also like to better understand why 4x4 matrices don't support Euclidean four space, but do support Minkowsi.
<p>
Finally, I want to spend some more time pondering the possibility of Minkowski space being an assembly error, where a bivector was mistakenly
used for time. At the very least, I should be able to get a nice scifi shortstory. At the best, there may be something really good here.

<h3>3D Euclidean Geometric Algebra and Matrix Representation</h3>
<br>
We cannot represent 3D Euclidean Geometric Algebras
using 3x3 matrices. The determinant of the negative unit matrix is
negative, and cannot be obtained as a square of 3x3 matrices with real
elements. Consequently, we must venture into the 4x4 matrices to represent
our three dimensional space of interest. As each 4x4 matrix has 16 degrees
of freedom, and we only require 8 for our 3D multivectors, we anticipate
multiple valid representations.

Here is a list of six representations for 3D Euclidean Geometric Algebra
using 4x4 matrices.  Another 42 are easily made by sign permutations
on the x, y and z vectors.

To identify vectors, which square to positive one, I wrote a program treating each cell of the 4x4
matrix as a location which could be -1, 0 or +1. In effect, this defines each possible matrix as a 
sixteen digit trinary number. In this fashion, I identified 5436 matrices which square to one. To be
more  <a href="4x4_blocks.c">selective</a>, I then further required each candidate have a non-zero determinant, 
and twelve zeroes.
This reduced the vector list to 76, but looking at the list, there were a number of entries with
trace 2 or -2, which would not be orthogonal to the unit vector. Consequently, I further restricted
the list by requiring trace = 0, which lead to the short list of <a href="42_Vectors.c">42 vector candidates</a>. (Douglas Adams fans
should take note.) Of these 42 entries, half are negatives of the other half, so we really have 21 unique entries.

Next, I formed all 21 x 21 products, looking for antisymmetric pairs whose product squared to negative one.
These products can be either bivectors or trivectors, depending upon the context of the basis vectors chosen.
Examing the feeders for each bivector/trivector candidate, I identified <a href="SixCandidates.c">six sets</a> of positive representations
for 3D Euclidean Clifford algebras.

<h3>2D Euclidean Geometric Algebra and Matrix Representation</h3>
<br>

When using quaternions and complex numbers, we become familiar with
two interpretations of these items, one as a number, and the other,
as an operator. A similar situation exists with multivectors and geometric
algebra. Usually, practicioners of GA are using a vector-like notation,
and have rulebooks describing the multiplication table of elements,
and are interested in the relationships between multivectors and their
various products at an application level. 
<p>
I am currently re-examining GA with an eye toward what the basis vectors
*really are*, rather than what they do. As a tool in this investigation,
I am examining the matrix representations of the basis elements, and treating
the implied coordinate transformations as a reality, as opposed to a 
book-keeping convenience.
<p>
There is somewhat of a chicken and the egg circular reference in this situation.
Because geometric algebra is associative, and has a multiplication table, we can
find a matrix representation for the elements of this algebra. Now that I am 
examining these matrix elements, I begin to suspect things are the other way around.
Each basis matrix has a clear geometrical meaning, usually involving reflections or 
rotations. Reflections, in turn, look like a rotation through 180 degrees in a transverse 
higher dimensional space. I suspect that the elements of GA are these fundamental
rotations potentially projected from a higher space. I suspect that the associative
nature of GA is the result of the matrix representation of these fundamental rotational
elements.

<h3>Sign Conventions, Metrics, and Geometric Algebra</h3>
<br>

We have a large number of possible sign conventions for geometric algebra (2^(2^n))
, as well as a larger number different metrics (3^(2^n)).
To help form my opinions about what I like, I write small programs to explore these different 
possibilities.
My previous work in this section was seriously flawed, due to careless sign errors invalidating
the products for anything other than standard numerical order. (Wrong indices were used for
calculating the sign when re-arranging the printing order of the equations.)
These invalid programs have been
removed, and replaced with a correctly written set. 
<p>
These program are written
in C to create generic geometrical multivector products in 4D, with choice of /+1/0/-1/ for 
each metric, choice of +/- 1 for each multivector component convention, and a nice
printout of the generic multivector product, as well as the standard collection of
vector*vector, vector*bivector, vector*trivector, vector*quadvector, bivector*trivector and
so on expressions.

<h3>Preferred Canonical Form for 3D Euclidean Geometric Algebra</h3>
<br>

Having gained more experience with geometric algebra, I have formed an opinion
about my preferred canonical form. I prefer the cyclic bivector format, as 
opposed to the ascending numerical basis format, as it clearly shows scalar
product terms in the products of vectors and bivectors. A demonstration program
using the GiNaC library is  <a href="CL3R3.ginac.cp">CL3R3.ginac.cp </a>

<h3>Curvature State Multivectors in Geometric Algebra</h3>
<br>

The Frenet-Serret formulas in classical 3D analytic geometry define a curve in terms of 
pathlength, curvature (deviation from a line) and torsion (deviation from a plane). 
These formulas easily extend to higher dimensions, with the addition of higher order curvatures.
This note takes these concepts of deviation, and uses geometric algebra to find a surprisingly
simple multivector which encodes the instantaneous state of a curve.

<h3>Two Points of View on EM Using Geometric Algebra</h3>
<br>

Geometric Algebra is a superior replacement for vector algebra. Here is a formula
dump for two versions of EM in GA. First, a three dimensional model where the
electric field is a vector field, while the magnetic field is a bivector field.
Second, a four dimensional model where both E and M fields (as well as our 
apparent coordinates) are bivectors, with one axis for E in the time direction,
while both B component are spacelike.

<h3>Component Equations for Geometric Algebra</h3>
<br>

Geometric Algebra is an approach to multidimensional physics and geometry
based upon associative, non-commutative, directed geometric products. This algebra
replaces the cross product of three dimensions, and the quaternions of four dimensions,
with a much more general set of concepts. 
<p>
Usually, practitioners of GA (Geometric Algera) avoid component level work, preferring
to use symbolic multiplication in the same manner as vector arithmetic operators prefer
to avoid components, using vector symbols instead.
<p>
I find for myself, however, that I need to be able to explain concepts to a computer
to be sure that I understand these concepts myself. Accordingly, I need to be able to
write code working with GA at the component level.
<p>
Below is a multiplication table and set of component equations for the Euclidean 3D
Multivector products. Each bit in the numbers below indicates a directional basis, so
the directional unit basis are e.1, e.2 and e.4 in the table below. The scalar term is
e.0, which commutes with all other terms. The bivector terms (directed areas) are e.3, e.5 and e.6, and the 
pseudo-scalar (volume element) is e.7.

<h3>Ramanujan's Challenge</h3>

Around 1910, Ramanujan, devotee of Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, posed a number of puzzles

of which was to evaluate
<mathml>
\sqrt{1 + 2 \sqrt{1 + 3 \sqrt{1 + 4 \sqrt{1 + 5\sqrt{ . . .}}}}} 
</mathml>
This note walks through one solution of this puzzle, hopefully expressing my deep appreciation of

<h3>Summertime Science Fiction and Back of the Envelope</h3>
<br>
<p>
Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter have released "The Long Mars", the third book in the Long Earth series.
This book is a fine bus ride companion, being little snippets easily interrupted and resumed. This book
overall is nothing exciting. The best insight from this book is that stepping spaces are gravitationally coupled,
and that the step-space for Earth versus the step-space for Mars do not necessarily align.
<p>
In the Universe as a Simulation theme, the Baryon Imbalance number is the ratio mismatch of the initial number
of matter versus anti-matter in the initial universe. According to Ning Bao and Prashant Saraswat, this ratio is
between 6.5 to 5.9 E-10. Now, having taught a few computer courses, I recognise this number as being very close to the
imbalance between positive versus negative values in 32 bit computers. We have a slight asymmetry in signed, twos
complement numbers where we can go one count more negative than positive. For 32 bit numbers, the range is
2147483647 to -2147483648, and the imbalance is 1/2^32 = 2.32830643654e-10. Numerically scaling by e, to get a
pre-desired result, has e/2^32 = 6.32899307753e-10, within the range quoted above. My scifi alter-ego loves the 
idea that we are in a simulation, where a vendor substituted a cheaper binary processor in place of the specified
trinary processor, and we are the accidental result of this unauthorized substitution.
<p>
The concept of our universe being the interior of a rotating black hole in 5 space has gained significant traction
during the last twenty years. I am very appreciate of "The Universe is Only Spacetime" by John A. Macken for many
of the insights he presents. I especially like his treatment of the connection between gravitational potential,
and escape velocity as the paradigm to look at gravity, rather than the point of view of acceleration and
gravitation potential gradient. He points out that the escape velocity from the center of the earth is higher than
the escape velocity from surface of the earth at the north pole, which in turn is higher than the escape velocity
at the equator. Let's use this approach to the formation of a black hole in five-space, and how it would appear to
the observers inside at later times. Being a sci-fi fan, I use the analogy of an illegal trash dump, where our villian
has continued to dump refuse. At the center of the dump, the escape velocity is increasing with each load until - uh oh -
we hit criticality. Treating lightspeed as a limit, the innermost radii begins to bubble outward, with the interior
empty due to the prohibition of crossing the luminal barrier. This is the big bang initiation for this new island universe.
The wavefront propagates outward at increasing speed as overlayers fall into the event horizon. This is the inflationary
epoch. Once the event horizon has consumed the mass of the illegal garbage dump, inflation stops, being starved of new
mass, and the system begins a new life as a quasi stable black hole on the outside, brand new universe on the inside.
Interior properties of the membrane are set by the mass, charge and rotation of the blackhole; this will generally be different
for each universe. As the universe really is the membrane of the black hole, dimensionality is down by one. Our five dimensional
black hole hosts a four dimensional universe. Our four dimensional universe has its own black hole decendents which
have three dimensional universes, and so on. Given that the black holes have angular momentum, one of the directional
degrees of freedom will not be symmetrical, such as our time, versus r, theta and phi. Some fun here, is that
true four dimensional space can support two orthogonal rotations spaces. . .

<h3>Cartesian Ovals</h3>
<br>

Cartesian ovals were first described by Rene Descartes, as a generalization of the ellipse. 
Instead of the sum of distance from two foci being a constant, he allowed the sum to be a generalized
linear relationship. Hugyens and Newton
studied these curves for their application in diffractive optics. As we come more to the present day, we find Maxwell taking an interest in these
curves at age 14. Prior to Maxwell, and rediscovered by Maxwell, Chasle found a third focus. More recently,
and my primary source for these notes, Benjamin Harrison in the 1887 edition of his Differential Calculus, provides
a geometric study of the Cartesian ovals.
This note presents the Cartesian ovals, and identifies the focii algebraicly, and provides the explicit linear
relationships connecting the three foci.

<h3>From the Ellipse to the Ogg Curve</h3>

The ellipse is commonly presented in parametric form using sines and cosines. It
is easy, but wrong, to assume that this is related to polar format. This informal note
presents the parametric ellipse, then shows the conversion to CRC format polar form,
then to double angle polar form. From the double angle polar form of the ellipse, I
introduce the closely related Ogg curve, which has connections to the harmonic-geometric
mean, and elliptic integrals of the second kind.

<h3>Numerical Inverse Elliptic Integrals of the Second Kind</h3>

<br>

The elliptic integral of the second kind can be used to measure
distance along a unit ellipse, measured from the minor radius. This
function is also found in electromagnetism, as well as physics, yet
does not have a consensus defined inverse function. This is like 
having arcsin, but not sine functions in your mathematical toolkit.

In the absense of a formal inverse function, several people have implemented
a simple numerical inverse function.

J. P. Boyd uses Newton's method and a clever initialization to invert elliptic integrals of the 
second kind, published in``Numerical, Perturbative and Chebyshev Inversion of the Incomplete 
Elliptic Integral of the Second Kind'', in Applied Mathematics and Computation (January 2012).

This approach was used by  Moiseev Igor and the Google Elliptic team implementing elliptic 
functions in Maple, where I first learned of this approach. 
The Google function is invE = inverselliptic2(E,m,tol) at
http://elliptic.googlecode.com.

Their source code for matlab is at

http://code.google.com/p/elliptic/source/browse/trunk/inverselliptic2.m

My preference is to use c, so here is a gsl compatible, c implementation of the
inverse Elliptic Integral of the Second Kind.

<h3>Dirac's Monopole Trick</h3>

the electric field, and Faraday's electric field lines, may have a Dirac
basis, as opposed to the radial Coulomb basis.

<h3>Hyperbolic Product Preserving Transforms</h3>

inverse. This note however, show a nice way to carry out this

<h3>Exercises with Magnetic Monopoles</h3>

<br>
Magnetic monopoles are a natural extension to electrodynamics. In this set of notes,
I look at the angular momentum of the fields associated with a pure electric
charge, and a pure magnetic monopole. Using a purely classical approach, I obtain
the standard result that a pure monopole and a pure electric charge will have a component
of angular momentum independent of separation. 

When integrating the angular momentum using cylindrical coordinates,
I gain an insight not seen with delta function or spherical integration approaches. 
I find that half the spin of this system is concentrated in the planes between the two charges.
As the separation between charges approaches zero, this spin concentration becomes immense, being 
a planar delta function. 

Next, I look at duality of electric and magnetic charges under the Maxwell equation. I find that
the maximum spin for a electron/monopole mix is too small to account for the known electron spin.
This conclusion does not rule out inherent spin due to duality in the electron, but rather states
there must be other sources for spin, such as dual monopole creating a dipole, or magnetic field
due to circulation of electronic charge.

<h3>The Parson Ring Model of the Electron</h3>

<br>
In 1915, Alfred Lauck Parson published "A Magneton Theory of the Structure of the Atom"
in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection, Pub 2371. In his paper, he proposed a spinning ring model of the electron, where the magnetic force associated with the
current ring provided the binding forces of chemical bonds. This model received attention from Arthur H. Compton, Clinton Davisson, Lars O. Grondahl, David L. Webster, and H. Stanley Allen, but fell out of favor due to the rise of quantum mechanics. This model has been periodically rediscovered, most recently by
Suichi Iida, W. Bostick, David Bergman, J. Paul Wesley, and Philip Kanarev.

This paper provides a closed form solution for the electric and magnetic potentials
of a spinning charged ring, demonstrates *why* the ring must rotate at the speed of light,
and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Parson model.

<h3>Hunting the Elusive Pigtailed Electrocrab!</h3>

(using a short rotor, or using only one of two arc magnets, (with
the coil acting as a closing switch again), and a lighting
demonstration using an open coil with hairline wires to run the

tricks is not as much fun as actually building a non-working

<h3>Interior Partitioning The Tetrahedron</h3>

<br>
 We can generate embedded polyhedra by a simple technique. Between
any two vertices which make an edge, we create a new vertex for the
embedded polyhedra in the middle of that edge. Joining those new
vertices generates the new solid. For the case of the cube, this
process immediately results in a truncated cube, the cuboctahedron.
Curiously enough, we can also generate the cuboctahedron by two
stages of dividing the tetrahedron. The end of the first stage
results in an octohedron. Dividing the octahedron results in a
cuboctahedron. While the tetrahedron and octohedron are stiff
structures, the cube and cuboctahedron are not. Internally bracing
the cuboctahedron with a twelve point star does achieve a stiff
structure with cartesian orientation and stackability. <br>

 The SpeakJet is an artificial speech IC found on the VoiceBox

provides recognizable speech. The default demo "All your base are
belong to us" was pleasant and easily understood. However, the
effort to create new phrases was rather steep. SpeakJet provides a
free application - PhraseALator - to convert text to their
numerical codes. However, words not in their dictionary are
ignored, and left to the user to provide. I really like my robots
to speak, yet I am very lazy. So, what to do?<br>
 <br>
 The happy answer is to examine open source text to speech systems,
looking for existing text to speech which I can modify. One such
answer is the Festival Light (flite) software from Carnegie-Mellon.
After compiling their software (used in many Asterisk PBX systems,
as an aside), I use the t2p application to convert text to
phonemes. I then convert their phonemes to SpeakJet codes using a
sed script (beware - this is a Linux command line) - <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/Flite2Speakjet.sed">Flite2Speakjet.sed</a>
- provided in the link previous. Now, the codes provided don't
modify pitch, and are not comprehensive, yet they get me much
further toward recognizable speech than the official solution
provided.<br>
 <br>
 Sample sequence of commands<br>
 <br>
 t2p "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country" &gt; moose.txt<br>
 sed -f Flite2Speakjet.sed moose.txt &gt; rawcodes.txt<br>
 <br>
 I then use a text editor to place the codes into the Arduino
program, and then begin modifying by adding pitch and pauses until
I am satisfied.<br>

<h3>Know Limits - No Limits<br>
</h3>

I was recently asked by Balu Kumar to provide a short speech prior
to the First Lego League Robotics Competition for elementary and
middle schools hosted by Westwood High School (our local high
school). I very much respect Dean Kaman, who founded First, and
National Instruments, who provided a simplified version of LabView
for the competitors. However, in general, I tend to reject any
restrictions on possible solutions for problems, such as use of
Lego kits as the only mechanical basis, rather than custom designed
components. While we have to know our limits, I prefer no limits.
This became the theme of this <a href=

<h3>Tachyonic Neutrinos and Excellent Science<br>
</h3>

<br>
 I am very impressed with CERN's professionalism in verifying and
publicizing the tachyonic nature of neutrinos. I have done nothing
in this area, but I am so pleased with their work, that I want to
publicly thank these many people. 

<p>Like any major event, there have been prophets who correctly
called reality. In this case, George Sudarshan, Chodos, Hauser,
Kosteleck, Ehrlich and Eue Jin Jeong are some names to look
for.</p>

<p>Chodos, I believe, makes the correct assertion that the left
hand only helicity of neutrinos, and the right hand only helicity
of anti-neutrinos, guaranteed luminal or tachyonic speeds, and that
the presence of neutrino flavor oscillation locked out luminal only
speeds leaving strictly superluminal speeds for neutrinos. Because
his argument is so neat, I've spent some time to understand his
points, and I'm hoping to be able to communicate his arguments.</p>

<p>Neutrinos have an inherent spin, and consequently can be thought
of as following a spiral path as they propagate. A good mental
picture is to think of the tips of a propellor on an airplane. As
the plane flies, the tips of the propellor trace a spiral path.
Helicity is measure of the torsion of a spiraling curve. If we are
stationary, watching a plane advance toward us, counter-clockwise
rotation of the propellor and the closing radial distance traces
out a right hand thread, in the sense of screw. This is positive
torsion, positive helicity. Now, assume we change our speed from
stationary to faster than the airplane. The airplane is now
separating from us, as we leave the airplane behind. From our point
of view, the trajectory of the propellor tips has changed from a
counter-clockwise motion approaching to a counter-clockwise motion
receding. The apparent pitch of the spiral, from our point of view,
has become negative, and is described as a left handed screw with
negative torsion (from our point of view).</p>

<p>We can directly measure high energy neutrinos, and we indirectly
infer high and low energy neutrinos when looking at particle
decays. The experimental fact is that we see only left-hand
neutrinos, and only right-hand anti-neutrinos. If neutrinos
travelled at subluminal speeds, a change of reference velocity
would guarantee a mix of left and right handed neutrinos. The lower
in energy, the closer to 50/50 the randomized mix should be.
Because we see *none*, we know neutrinos had to be luminal or
beyond.</p>

<p>Now for the fun stuff here. Ordinarily, when we work with mass,
we are dealing with stable particles. (Think electrons, protons,
etc.) Mass for these particles is a real number, corresponding to
an inverse spatial distance in natural units. Unstable particles,
on the other hand (think muons, neutrons, etc.), get an imaginary
component of mass proportional to the inverse particle lifetime.
Particles with mass, even imaginary mass, cannot propagate at light
speed. Consequently, when the solar neutrino paradox of 1/3
neutrino flux came up, when physicist proposed neutrino flavor
oscillations, this implied neutrino mass, and that, in turned,
ruled out luminal speeds. (Neutrino flavor oscillations have been
experimentally verified using reactor generated neutrinos, emitted
as electron neutrinos, with time correlated detection of electron
and muon neutrinos at remote detectors. Japanese Kat experiment,
Minnesota experiment.)</p>

<p>Chodos argument from 1985 is thus: Neutrinos can't be
subluminal, can't be luminal, must be superluminal.</p>

<p>First verification was supernova 1987A, where neutrinos were
detected prior to optical spotting. (Found in retrospect.)
Arguments about the delayed photons propagating from the supernova
core prevented this observation from being conclusive, but
certainly provided indication. Consequently, experiments which
generated time resolved, spatially resolved neutrino beams began to
look for time of flight measurements. Fermilab MINOS measured
superluminal speeds, but the uncertainty in the measurements were
less than six standard deviations, and consequently was not deemed
definitive. CERN, in turn, has followed up, and reduced measurement
uncertainties to the six sigma standard.</p>

<p>Implications for future supernova detection: The supernova
events have a large neutrino pulse at fairly constant energy during
the collapsing phase transformation (flash), followed by rapidly
cooling neutrinos from the hot neutron core. As high energy
neutrinos travel slower than low energy neutrinos, (think of
proximity to light speed being the high energy condition), we will
see the time reversed rising sizzle, then flash for supernova
events. Being specific, if we see an increasing neutrino flux
coming from Betelguese or Eta Carinae, we would then later see the
high energy neutrino flash followed by the optical event.</p>

<p>This would be a very interesting verification, to say the
least.</p>

<h3>Virtual Particles and Four-Space Trajectories<br>
</h3>

<br>
 In four-space, trajectories with constant curvature, torsion and
lift are trapped on a hypersphere of fixed radius. To moving
observers, such as ourselves, as we move along the time axis, we
will see a transient disturbance as the trapped particle passes our
time plane. For particles with specific ratios of
curvature:torsion:lift, we will see a pair of particles form,
separate, re-approach and disappear. For most cases, however, we
will see a scatter of a large number of particle pairs, which last
no longer than the transit time of our time motion over the
diameter of the trapped particle hypersphere. The mathematics of
the constant curvature trajectories is given in <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/ThreeCurvatures.pdf">Curves of Constant
Curvatures in Four Dimensional Spacetime</a>. To show these curves
in four dimensions, the program <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/RK4.c">RK4.c</a> is provided. This
program compiles with any C compiler, and produces two files.
Curves.xyzt is a four dimensional coordinate set intended to be
used with hyper.c, as described below. Curves.xyt is a projection
into three-space, suitable for use with the truss.c and flyby.c
programs, also referenced below.<br>

<h3>Frenet-Serret Formulas In Quaternion Format<br>
</h3>

<br>
 The three dimensional Frenet-Serret formulas describe a trajectory
using pathlength (deviation from a point) as a parameter, and
specifying curvature (deviation from a line) and torsion (deviation
from a plane) as a function of pathlength. Two curves with the same
curvature and torsion histories are congruent, despite origin,
translation or rotations. It is tempting to describe physics by
having laws specify curvature and torsion. In practice, however,
the time history is essential, as different time histories and
forces can result in similar spatial curves. Consequently, if one
wants to describe physics by curvature and torsion, one must move
to four dimensional spacetime, and accept another curvature, which
I call lift, measuring deviation from a volume. It turns out that
the quaternion divisional algebra is a natural fit for the
Frenet-Serret equations extended to four-space. It also turns out
that the left handed space form has a pleasing simplicity. Even
more fun, it is easy to extend curvatures from scalar to vectors,
with an interesting alignment occuring in fourspace between
curvature and lift. <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/QuaternionCurvatures.pdf">Quaternion
Curvatures</a> presents the left handed, four dimensional
Frenet-Serret equations, initially scalar form, later vector
curvature form. In addition to the Frenet forms, formulas for
curvatures paramaterized by an arbitrary parameter, such as proper
time, or angular position, are provided.<br>

<h3>Superluminal Weber Force Laws Simulations<br>
</h3>

<br>
 The <a href="http://www.kurtnalty.com/WeberForce.pdf">Weber force
law</a> is solved for orbits using the technique shown in Clemente
and Assis, Int-J-Theor-Phys-V30-p537-545(1991), as well as Assis -
Weber's Electrodynamics 1994. Having verified agreement with low
speed orbits with significant angular momentum, I then go the the
extremes of tachyonic behavior for a zero angular momentum pair of
particles. The solution has repeating behaviors criticized by
Helmholtz, but which I view as fascinating. Specifically, we see
two particles collide at 1.414c, pass transparently through each
other at speed, accelerate to infinite speed in a finite distance,
change direction at infinite speed (which corresponds to zero
kinetic energy for tachyons), fall through zero radius again at
1.414c, then expand outward as classical particles, slowing to zero
speed, then repeating the fall toward zero again.This exercise does
not describe reality as we know it, as Weber's law does not use
delayed potential, nor was mass scaled relativistically. However,
this exercise has provided insight into tachyonic behavior, with a
critical speed not of c, but 1.414c.<br>

<h3>Equivalent Magnetic Force Laws<br>
</h3>

<br>
 <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/AmpereBiotSavartWeberFormulasWithCode.pdf">
Equivalent force laws</a> have been a source of conflict among
electrical students since the time of Ampere, Maxwell and
Heaviside. Periodically, a new batch of enthusiasts discover
alternative force laws, but aren't aware that these force laws
cannot be distinguished using macroscopic closed current sources
for magnetic fields. To distinguish between various proposed force
law requires electron scale modelling, which is a topic for my next
posting. The pdf above provides MKS representation of five
different force laws, shows equivalent macroscopic observables, yet
different differential force elements. Source code for the open

<h3>Flyby - An Immersive, Interactive, 3D Wireframe Plotter<br>
</h3>

<br>
 <a href="http://www.kurtnalty.com/flyby.pdf">Flyby</a> was
initially written as a Macintosh application in the 1990s, to allow
translation through a data set, as well as rotations. For stiff
problems, where multiple resonances exist on widely different
timescales, it is useful to be able to zoom in to see small
oscillations which are superimposed upon slow changes. Flyby served
me well when studying trajectories. <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/flyby.c">Flyby.c</a> is an open source,
Linux/X-windows port in C with minimal dependencies. 
<p>
Edit 23 January 2015. John Hanniball of http://anachrocomputer.blogspot.com/
noted that the previously posted version of flyby.c did not correctly
use divide by z for perspective function. I had incorrectly posted one of 
my experiments using radial scaling, as with projection on a sphere rather 
than a rectangular plane. I have left the radial lines commented out in the code,
and corrected the perspective function for conventional z scaling.

<h3>"Magnetic Hematite"</h3>

<br>
 A novelty sold at local fairs are 'Snake Eggs', made in China,
billed as magnetized hematite. The first observation is that the
residual field in these magnets is quite strong, seeming comparable
to neodynium/boron magnets. The second observation is that the
material a tough, impact tolerant, ceramic. The third, is that this
material is a good insulator. This is clearly an interesting
material for permanent magnets motors. So, it is time to
investigate.

<li>BearHaversack.com sells `magnetic hematite' by the pound. I
bought a five pound bag of various geometrical shapes (not the
Snake Eggs shape). These appear to be the same base material, but
have parallel planes for easy magnetization.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Ascertain the actual material used. Hematite is not naturally
magnetic.<br>
<br>

<li>From http://www.webmineral.com/data/Hematite.shtml<br>
 Hematite - Fe2 O3 (Fe 3+)<br>
 Molecular weight 159.69 gm<br>
 No residual magnetic field<br>
 Reddish brown streak<br>
<br>
 So, first, easy tests are the magnetic and streak tests.<br>
<br>
 Compare with hematite ore samples from BearHaversack. The ore is
non-magnetic. The ore streak test against white unglazed ceramic
(bottom of coffee cup) is reddish brown for mineral hematite, but
blackish grey for "magnetic hematite". These are clearly different
materials. Checking the internet for other investigations, we find
. . .<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>From http://www.mindat.org/min-1856.html<br>
 NOTE - the 'hematite' used in jewelery, and often sold as
magnetized items, is nothing of the sort and is an artificially
created material, see Magnetic Hematite.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>From http://www.mindat.org/min-35948.html<br>
 An artificially created magnetic material (this contains NO
natural Hematite) widely sold as 'magnetic hematite' or simply
'hematite'. Please note that the name 'hematite' is quite
misleading, as this is NOT a natural stone.<br>
<br>
 Investigation of one item offered for sale as 'magnetic hematite'
showed it was composed of a ceramic barium-strontium ferrite
magnet: (Ba,Sr)Fe12O19 that has the magnetoplumbite structure. The
average grain size of the ceramic is 5-10 microns, and the porosity
is 10-15%. In addition, the magnetic field strength of this
material is much larger than that of any magnetite specimen. Other
items were identified as magnetoplumbite-type SrFe12O19.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I measured the density of twelve of the BearHaversack magnets
by using an A&amp;D Model HJ-150 scale to measure weight, and a
small beaker to measure volume. To isolate magnetic effects, I used
an eight inch tall piece of styrofoam packing to keep the magnets
away from the ferrous material in the base of the scale. To verify
accurate measurement of the mass of the magnets, rather than mass
and magnetic attraction to ferrous materials in the base and
supports, the magnets were doubled over to form a quadrapole,
rather than dipole, and the magnets were re-measured in multiple
directions and orientations while observing the same measured mass.
The total mass was 180.5g, the volume (measured by water
displacement in a beaker), was 38 mL. The density is 4.75 g/mL. (As
opposed to 5.6 for hematite.) CY-Magnetics calls out a density of
4.8 to 4.9 for their Hard Ceramic Ferrite materials.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>CY-Magnetics' ceramic magnets have a Curie temperature of about
450 C. Red hot is about 520 C. Heating in an oven did not get hot
enough to demagnetize the sample. Heating with a propane torch
resulted in brittle failure due to too high a rate of heating.
Instrumented kiln heating looking for magnetic drop is probably
required to measure an accurate Curie temperature.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>The surface residual magnetic field was measured using a
Sypris/FWBell FH-520 (177101) Hall probe. This probe has a nominal
sensitivity of 100mV/T when run at an excitation of 25 mA. I did
not do a Helmholtz calibration on this particular probe. The
particular probe has a 3.5 mV offset, and was run at 22.9 mA, for
an estimated sensitivity of 91.3 mV/T. Measurements were made with
the probe white side up and then in the same place with the probe
white side down, the numbers subtracted and divided by two to
reduce the offset voltage. The BearHaversack magnets had a residual
field of 0.17T to 0.26T, highest near edges, lower in middle of
faces. By contrast, my neodynium magnets measured 0.52T. These
numbers are consistent with a Y10 ceramic material for the
BearHaversack material, and a half-magnetized N27 neodynium
material.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion - This really great magnetic material is not
hematite. It happens to be a really great magnetic material,
probably barium-strontium ferrite ceramic.</p>

<p>Future work - I want to make samples of magnetite via the
Massurt method both for ferrofluid fun and for characterization of
magnetite's magnetic properties.</p>

<h3>Project 42</h3>

<br>
 The Answer is 42.<br>
 <br>
 Really.<br>
 <br>
 Complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are division algebras,
where multiplication and magnitudes can be defined in such a way
that the magnitude of a product is also the product of the
magnitude of the two multiplying terms. This type of product then
allows us to define division. My fascination has been the fact that
there are so many different formulas in these two, four, and eight
dimensional spaces that also satisfy the norm relationship above.
Initially, I used brute force to enumerate working algebras,
finding 2^3 solutions for the complex family (comps), 2^8 solutions
for the quaternion family (quads), and 2^19 families for the
octonion familty (octs). These individual solutions are merely
choices for the polarity (sign) of the product terms in the
defining basis multiplication table. 

<p>The encoding of the basis vectors as binary numbers, and the
product base being given by XOR is worth illustrating numerically,
as some interesting interpretations can be made about
dimensionality and multiplication. For traditional quaternions, we
have numbers and three spatial dimensions. Borrowing notation from
spacetime, I'll call t=00 as the numbers (scalars), i=01 as one
space axis, j=10 as another space axis, and k=11 as a third. The
multiplication table is</p>

The interesting interpretation of the above, seen in Clifford
algebra and geometric algebra, is that the quaternion table above
is *not* a four dimensional structure, but rather a two dimensional
structure, where the multiplication terms involving i and j give
rise to an areal term k. In a similar fashion, complex numbers are
really dealing with a one dimensional space, and octonions with a
three dimensional space. To get a real space-time (four true
dimensions), will require sedenions. 

<p>Knowing that the basis multiplication table can be encoded as
binary numbers XORed together, and seeing the power of two number
of solutions, I decided that I should examine the solutions as a
digital logic problem. Given that the basis logic was XOR based, I
was pleased to find Reed-Muller XOR implementations of the sign or
polarity logic found above.</p>

<p>Having found digital logic solutions for normed algebras in two,
four and eight dimensions, my next target was 16 dimensions.
Sedenions are known to not be normal. While I can find numerical
special cases where two integer sixteen vectors and a sixteen
vector product satisfy the norm relations (based upon any integer
being the sum of four squares), there is no general formula. <a
href="http://www.kurtnalty.com/ReverseGamma.c">Doing the sixteen
bit digital exercise</a>, despite knowing unlikely success, led to
an interesting <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/ReverseGamma.txt">result</a>. In my
approach, I used one bit to determine an active high/active low
default state for a bit. I then used higher order bits to determine
participation of free variables in the sign of the term in the
multiplication table. The interesting result, is that while I had
conflicting definitions for active high/active low default bit
states, I had a consistent set of definitions for how the default
state would be modified by <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/seds/variations.html">42 free
variables</a>.</p>

<p>This result has me very excited. I've always wanted to find a
simple explanation for quantum superposition. My hope is to find a
simple, mathematical analog to the ring oscillator or logic
paradox, where a feedback path with an odd number of inversions,
coupled with a propagation delay through the logic creates an
inherently oscillating system. A multiplication table which is
inherently oscillatory, gives rise to an oscillatory metric, which
in turn justifies much of our experience with quantum multivalued
weirdness. Philosophically, an inherently oscillating metric
structure of space is a good model for Planck scale quantum foam,
and in the bigger picture, justification for 'free will', or
non-predestination, on the quantum scale.</p>

<p>So, what do I know? I know that the base definition is
inconsistent, and that there are flaws (inherent conflicts) in my
model for the multiplication table logic. However, I also know,
that once a suitable basis is defined, I can give <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/seds/variations.html">2^42 new
variations</a> on a successful basis.</p>

<p>My current task is to re-examine <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/norm.pdf">fundamentals</a> of division
algebras. I am re-evaluating the works by Hamilton, Cayley,
Kirkland, Clifford, and other great mathematicians from the
1840-1890s, as well as Sylvester (1867), Hadamard (1893) and Walsh
(1923) in more recent times. My most recent influence is the
geometric algebra interpretation of Clifford algebras by David
Hestenes.</p>

<p>My current working assumptions are<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Complex numbers are associated with one dimensional spaces.
There are three degrees of binary freedom associated with complex
numbers, giving 8 (2^3) different <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/comps/comps.html">comps</a>.</li>

<li>Quaternions are associated with two dimensional spaces. There
are eight degrees of binary freedom, giving rise to 256 (2^8)
different <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/quads/quads.html">quads</a>.</li>

<li>Octonions are associated with three dimensional spaces. There
are nineteen degrees of binary freedom, giving rise to 2^19
different <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/octs/octs.html">octs</a>.</li>

<li>Each of the previous spaces have no ambiguity in the
calculation of their structure constants.</li>

<li>Sedenions are associated with four dimensional spaces. <a href=
"http://www.kurtnalty.com/seds/seds.html">Seds</a> and higher
spaces fail to form traditional division algebras. The failure to
form static division algebras at sedenions and beyond is well known
(Frobenius and Kirkland). One work around is the non-distributive
approach of <a href=
"http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/nce2.ps">Albrecht
Pfister</a> , kindly demonstrated in code by <a href=
"http://www.math.temple.edu/%7Ewds/homepage/szon3.c">Warren
Smith</a>. Another approach, that of J. R. Young (1848), is to note
that a product of 16 squares can be written as a sum of 32 squares
(using octonions), which can be mapped into complex components. My
new goal, is to use the complex definition of Young, and identify
<a href="http://www.kurtnalty.com/seds/variations.html">2^42
variations</a>.</li>

The Fibonacci numbers are deeply related to the Golden Ratio. Here
is a simple proof of the closed form equation for the n'th
Fibonnaci numbers. This formula can be extended to negative
integers, as well as treated as a continous function of n. This
continuous function has many similarities to the force law of Roger
Boscovitch.<br>

Every trajectory in space can be described by the curvature and
torsion as a function of pathlength. Pathlength differentially
measures deviation or distance from a point. Curvature
differentially measures deviation from a line. Torsion
differentially measures deviation from a plane. The circle is a
curve of constant curvature, while the spiral has constant
curvature and torsion. Extending to four dimensions, we now have
another curvature, "lift", which differentially measures lift out
of a volume. The curve of constant curvature, torsion and lift is a
trajectory on the surface of a hypersphere, consisting of
circulations at two different linear frequencies in orthogonal
plane sets.<br>
